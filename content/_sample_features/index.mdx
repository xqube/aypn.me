## Headings and Table of Contents Support
H2 and H3 headings are automatically extracted for the Table of Contents by `rehypeExtractToc`.
The anchor IDs are generated automatically from the text.

### H3 Heading Example
This is an H3 heading.

## Text Formatting (GFM)
**Bold text**, *Italic text*, ~~Strikethrough~~.
Tables are also supported:

| Feature | Support |
| :--- | :--- |
| GFM | Yes |
| MDX | Yes |

## Lists and Tasklists
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item

Tasklists:
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task

## Code Blocks (PrismJS)
Code blocks support syntax highlighting via `rehype-prism-plus`.

```javascript
// Example JavaScript block
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```

## Links and External Links
- [Internal Link](/blog)
- [External Link (opens in new tab)](https://example.com)

External links automatically receive `target="_blank"`, `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, and a class of `external-link`.

## Images
Local images in the same folder are officially supported by `rehypeRewriteImages` which rewrites `./foo.jpg` to `/blog/{slug}/foo.jpg`. To use this, create a folder for your post, put `index.mdx` and the images inside it.

![Local Image Example](./sample-image.jpg)

*(Make sure to put `sample-image.jpg` in the same directory as this `index.mdx` file!)*

## Raw HTML Support
Because `rehype-raw` is enabled, you can safely embed interactive elements like Twitter or Telegram widgets, or use arbitrary HTML:
<div style="padding: 1rem; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;">
  <strong>This is raw HTML rendering!</strong> You can embed `<script>` tags here too.
</div>

## Blockquotes
> This is a standard blockquote. It allows you to emphasize quotes or important notices.
